# Understanding REST

> Let's get you started with your first architectural style

## Overview

REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by [Roy Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding) in 2000 in his famous [dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

We'll introduce you to REST's guiding principles or constraints and a little bit about _HTTP methods_.

### So you've heard about REST or RESTful APIs

Now you're confused if those two things are the same or just similar right? Well let me help you out buddy!

The quick answer is â€” they're supposedly same but people can't just follow rules. Let me elaborate: If you don't know yet,
software architectural styles usually have their own guiding constraints or principles to follow. **REST** has six of them, and if
you are able to follow the said constraints without any breaking changes, your approach will be considered **RESTful**.
