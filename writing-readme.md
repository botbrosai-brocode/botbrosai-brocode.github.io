# Writing a README.md File

> Of course! We need a guideline to write our projects' guideline 

## Overview

A **README** file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software.

<hr>

### Why should I care about a README?

Aside from the reason that the open source community is growing rapidly. Developers in our team release projects in different languages, frameworks, and packages. Your README should be as good as your project. A great README file helps introduce our projects to other team members within the team or organization. It is the face of our projects, it should include enough details to help other team members get started, e.g. how to install, how to setup environments, and how to start integrating.

### Now as you agree that README matters in our projects

Here's a template with **important** points and description to help you write a README.

```markdown
# Project's Title

Add a single sentence or paragraph if you can so it can serve as the project's overview that 
explains what the project is about.

## Cloning the Repository

1. Use numbers instead of bullet points to explain.
2. Try to explain this one step by step.
3. If it's much easier for you to break down an already made cloning guide, then do so
to save time.

## Installing Dependencies

1. Don't forget to include this section to help out newcomers with your project dependencies
2. Again, explain it step by step, use numbers not bullet points
3. Try to elaborate briefly, a single sentence for each step will do

## Getting Started

### Environment

1. This section helps you out explain steps on how to setup an environment for a project.
2. Try to include the CLI commands you used in your project to help them save time.

### Database

1. Just like the Environment sub-section, try to explain here how to setup your project's 
database

### Usage

1. This sub-section is important, you must explain how a developer in the team should be 
able to run a local server etc.

### Note to Contributors

Use bullet points to post brief notes for your team members

#### General

* Include all of your general tips and notes here
* Include reference links to development practice guidelines
* You can update this anytime during the project

#### Sub-Section Sample

* If you have other specific topics to note, add separate sub-section to isolate it
from the general ones
```
